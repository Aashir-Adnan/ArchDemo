## Overview

The goal of this architecture is to make server and API development as simple and intuitive as possible. By leveraging a central configuration for each API object and dynamically resolving components in middleware, this architecture provides a highly configurable and reusable structure.

The project aims to:
- Automate authorization checks, parameter validation, and other common API tasks.
- Minimize redundant code by modularizing functionality like token validation and permission checking.
- Allow developers to focus on API logic rather than boilerplate setup.

## Features

- **Authorization and Token Validation**: Easily manage API access with configurable token-based authorization.
- **Parameter Validation**: Ensure API inputs meet predefined requirements before processing.
- **Modular Handlers**: Load and execute handlers dynamically from predefined directories.
- **OTP and Email Handling**: Includes support for sending and verifying OTPs as well as sending emails.
- **Middleware-Based Architecture**: API configurations are resolved in middleware, simplifying API logic.
- **Encryption and Multi-Step Processing**: Configure APIs with encryption and multi-step workflows.

## API Object Configuration

Each API is represented as an object with various configurable options. The following is an example of an API object that will be resolved in middleware and processed accordingly:

```js
{
  authorization: {
    accessToken: false,
  },
  multistep: true,
  encryption: true,
  parameters: true,
  validation: true,
  sendOTP: true,
  verifyOTP: false,
  querying: true,
  sendEmail: true,
  callBackFunction: true,
  pagination: false,
}
```

### Key Config Options:
- **authorization**: Controls access token validation.
- **multistep**: Enables multi-step processing for complex workflows.
- **encryption**: Indicates whether data should be encrypted.
- **parameters**: Toggles parameter validation middleware.
- **validation**: Enables validation of request data.
- **sendOTP**: Handles sending OTPs to users.
- **verifyOTP**: Verifies OTPs provided by users.
- **querying**: Enables database querying capabilities.
- **sendEmail**: Sends emails as part of the API process.
- **callBackFunction**: Executes callback functions for API customization.
- **pagination**: Enables pagination in API responses.

## Middleware Components

The project is built around a set of modular components, each performing a specific task in API processing. Some key middleware components include:

### Handlers:

1. **sendResponse**: Standardizes API responses.
2. **validateToken**: Validates access tokens for authorized requests.
3. **permissionChecker**: Checks user permissions based on the API request.
4. **loadHandlerFromDirectory**: Dynamically loads the appropriate handler from a specified directory.
5. **objectResolver**: Resolves the API object and processes it accordingly.
6. **validateParametersMiddleware**: Validates parameters in API requests.

### Global Variables:
- `global.objectCache`: Caches loaded handlers for reuse.
- `global.objectCache`: Caches permissions associated with API requests.

The middleware handles the core processing of API requests, dynamically loading handlers and resolving configuration settings for each API.

## Usage

1. Define your API object configuration for each API.
2. Middleware processes the request based on the configuration:
   - Token validation (platformToken and accessToken)
   - Permission checks
   - Parameter validation (see all validations in Constants/validateParameters.js)
   - Multi-step workflows
   - Optional OTP functionality
3. Handlers are dynamically loaded, and API logic is executed based on the resolved configuration.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```
4. Start the server using:

```bash
npm start
```
